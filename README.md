# Array Interators

A simple walkthrough on the array methods for iteration that `Array.prototype` provides us. 

The idea is to not only have an understanding on what each function does, but also how it is possibly defined in a raw implementation. 

To achieve this, it's being implemented a custom method inside `Array.prototype` to have an understanding on how these functions are being abstracted and that you can have access to it 

##### `⚠️ Don't modify the Array.prototype in production`

# Methods

- Array.prototype.**map()**
- Array.prototype.**flatMap()**
- Array.prototype.**filter()**
- Array.prototype.**forEach()**
- Array.prototype.**reduce()**
